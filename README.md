# Truth-Table-Generator


This repository contains Python code for a truth table generator and bitwise shift operation demonstration. The truth table generator generates truth tables for boolean expressions with support for up to four input variables. The provided truthTable function accepts a boolean expression and the number of input variables, then outputs the corresponding truth table. Additionally, the shift function demonstrates bitwise left and right shift operations.

Features:

* Generate truth tables for boolean expressions with up to four input variables.
* Perform bitwise left and right shift operations.
  
Usage:

Import the truthTable and shift functions into your Python script.
Call the truthTable function with your boolean expression and the number of input variables.
Call the shift function to perform bitwise left or right shift operations.

Example:
* expression = "A AND NOT (B XOR C)"
* truthTable(expression, 3)

* num = 5
* shift_by = 3
* result = shift(num, shift_by, "left")

Feel free to explore and use this repository for generating truth tables and performing bitwise operations in your Python projects!
